## Description

This is a website for the final project of my course Software Engineering. It can:
- Upload and categorize PDF files
- Track reading progress (how much percentage the user has to continue, how fast they have to read in order to catch up with the deadlines)
- Smart dictionary integrated: find the most suitable meaning of a word based on the context
- Flashcard learning: Learn vocabulary using flashcards
